# Resume

I started building my resume from here https://github.com/drehimself/resume-template <br/><br/>

I chose this template because it looked simple and professional. <br/></br>

I customized the template to make it work for me. In the past, I paid for templates that looked nice but I couldn't customize, there were some display issues, and not to mention monthly payments. <br/> <br/>

Technologies used were:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- npm
- parcel

<br/>

## Quick start

In your terminal or cmd <br/><br/>
run https: `git clone https://github.com/TamyresPortilho/resume.git` <br/>
or run ssh: `git clone git@github.com:TamyresPortilho/resume.git` <br/><br/>

Next run `cd resume` <br/><br/>

Make sure you have node js installed in your computer to run npm. I use nvm to install node but there is a better option out there. Follow the command here:

```
# install Volta
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

# install Node
volta install node

# start using Node
node
```

curl is a unix command. If you are a windows user, check out this installation guide [volta install](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)

<br/><br/>
Lastly, run npm to install our devDependencies and run our parcel server: <br/>

```
npm install
npm run start
```

<br/>
To access the server, run localhost:1234 on your browser.
